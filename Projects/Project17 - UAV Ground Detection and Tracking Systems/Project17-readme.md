Often a forest of trees has many different kinds of trees. In this project, we want to design a novel way to fly over a tree and determine what kind if tree it is, using a visual or biological sensor. Then, record the GPS point on the tree. At the end of a flight a map will show all of the GPS points for the specific variety of tree.
