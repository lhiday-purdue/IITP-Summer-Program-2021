Accidents based on vehicles failing to stop for red lights cause thousands of injuries and hundreds of deaths every year in the U.S. alone, and many more worldwide. Yet there is no effective method for alleviating this problem currently implemented on a large scale. The project will investigate possible solutions to identify when a driver is about to run a red light, how to notify them, and how to warn other drivers and pedestrians in the area.
